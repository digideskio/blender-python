# blender-python 
This project is a part of rinkak blogs (www.rinkak.com). You can create 3D model for 3D print using blender and python script. The blog is continuing, so sample codes in this repository will be updated periodically.

## Get started
1. First of all, you have to set up the environment to run python scripts in blender. I've already write [an article](https://www.rinkak.com/jp/blog/blender-python-modeling-1) about this issue, so please check it. (This article is currently written in Japanese, but it will be translated to English in the near future.)
2. Clone this repository to your local.
3. Run scripts like this.
```
blender -P tut1.py
```

## Complement
Codes in blenderlib are for auto-completion for your editor. Though these codes are not maintained for latest python api in blender, it may work well for almost part of your projects.
